Term Project - N-puzzle problem using A* algorithm

To begin with, to execute the program you need to first go to your terminal and change directory ("cd") into the project folder "TermProject".
Once there at the "\TermProject> " directory, input the following command:

" java -jar out\artifacts\TermProject_jar\TermProject.jar"

This will execute the program and you prompted enter the size of the board, the dimension of the puzzle board, you want to solve.
It will then generate a random starting board state for you to start with and watch it solve the puzzle. There is a chance for the
starting board state to be a unsolvable puzzle, so the program will prompt you if you puzzle is unsolvable so just re-execute the program.
